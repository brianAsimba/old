# Who is Brian Asimba?

I was born in Nairobi, Kenya in a big family of 8 kids. My parents always worked hard for us to have a better life, which gave me the morals of hard work and not giving up when things get tough. As I was growing up I was always fascinated with airplanes. It was in high school, junior year, when we were taught about airplanes and how they fly, their forces and how they are designed. After this, I always wanted to be an Aeronautical Engineer and I began looking at the best places to study it. However, my country did not offer any degrees in this field. My passion brought me to Western Michigan University, which had a transfer program with Egerton University. Below is a summary of my work experience, education and some of my short to long term goals.
